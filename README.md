### Imagine a less stressful first year? Because We DO! 

This is a basic map of Elkhorn Area High Schools. We hope that you find it useful in navigating around the school and eliminating some of the stress of the first year. However this isn't just for freshmen, this is for anyone interested in getting around EAHS easier.

## How to install the App

Unfortunately, we do not host our project on Google play. So you will have to manually install the App from our GitHub page. 

* First, Click and download the Zip file that we have up on the <>Code part of this page.

* Then, Extract the zip file to your android device. It should contain an APK file.

* Next, Go to your Android device settings and under security check the box marked "Unknown sources" It may give display a warning about installing app's from unknown locations, but don't worry. We didn't do anything that could harm your device. And if you don't believe me you can go read every line of code on the GitHub page.

* After that, Go to your downloads folder on your device and click and install the App.

## FQA

### Will you ever do an iOS version?
 
Not unless someone pays for development of that version

### Can I modify/fork/re-purpose it?

Yes, this is all released under GPL V2. I would be very happy if someone used it for something cool or improved it. As long as you follow GPL V2, you can do anything you want with it.

### Who can answer any other questions not answered on this page?

Anyone from EAHS guidance should be able to help you.
